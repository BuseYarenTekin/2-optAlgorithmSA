# 2-optAlgorithm for Simulated Annealing
Using 2-opt algorithm solution for simulating annealing for tsp problems

----------------------------------------
In the simulated backgammon swap method, two values are controlled with each other and stored according to the probability value. However, it will not be very efficient in terms of working time since all operations will be performed in sequence.

With the 2opt algorithm, for example, in the index values called initial_p (tour_p), it is seen that it is switching from node 4 to node 17. The 2opt algorithm enters the circuit to break the link between the nodes 4 and 5 and form the link between the nodes d and 17. Thus, the runtime produces more efficient results.
